## Why I built this

Honestly? **I needed it myself.**

I had a folder full of phone backups — thousands of `IMG_1234…` files mixed with videos — and every tool I tried felt slow, bloated, or wrong for the job. I didn't want a full photo library. I just wanted to **rename**, **sort into folders**, **trim the bad parts of videos**, and **move on** — as fast as possible, with my hands on the keyboard.

So I built **Quick Media Organizer**. It's not a startup pitch; it's a tool I use every day. I'm sharing it open source because I hope it helps someone else stuck with the same mess.

If it saves you time, I'd genuinely appreciate a [coffee ☕](https://buymeacoffee.com/ferran_vidal). It helps me keep improving it in my spare time.

## What it does

- **Rename** photos and videos in seconds with `Enter`
- **Move** files into subfolders like `gym/`, `trips/portugal/`, `paperwork/` with `Ctrl+F`
- **Trim videos losslessly** (FFmpeg stream copy — no re-encoding) before saving
- **Delete safely** to `_deleted/` inside your folder — never permanent, always undoable
- **Skip**, **navigate**, and **undo** without touching the mouse
- **Live Photos** (`.heic` + `.mov`) move, rename, and delete together
- Original **EXIF dates** and file timestamps are preserved

## FAQ

**Does Delete erase files forever?**  
No. Files go to `_deleted/` inside your media folder. Review them anytime.

**Will organizing change capture dates?**  
No. EXIF metadata and original timestamps are preserved.

**Videos and Live Photos?**  
Yes. Videos preview in-app and can be trimmed losslessly. Live Photo pairs stay in sync.

**HEIC on Windows?**  
Organizing works. Preview may fall back to metadata on some setups.

**FFmpeg for video trim?**  
Required for trimming. Install with `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/). Renaming and organizing work without it.
